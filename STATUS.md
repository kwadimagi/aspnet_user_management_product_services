## Final Note:
The application has been successfully transformed from a basic starter app to a production-grade fullstack application with all requested enhancements. It follows modern best practices for both .NET Core and React development.

The original issue with test files has been resolved by separating them to avoid build conflicts, while keeping the main application functional.
